Introduction
------------

The Android Market Manager library is a small library project for Android app developers to simplify interaction with various app markets.

Currently, it contains:

-Methods to link to the appropriate app store for either a single app, or all of a developer's apps
-Some library utilities for checking which device the app is running on


Also included is the test project, which is a handy way to check how linking to each market will work on a particular device.

Note that while documentation is currently light, the constants file contains a lot of description for how the linking occurs.  This may be useful for you even if you don't want to use the library itself.
